Sal Klita (absorption basket) calculator, 2026 rates.

Source of every number below: Ministry of Aliyah and Integration, "סל קליטה"
(https://www.gov.il/he/pages/absorption_basket), page updated 11.06.2026,
tables "לוח סיוע כספי בסל הקליטה" (three tracks) and "לוח תוספות לסל קליטה".
The tables are transcribed verbatim. Do NOT interpolate, index, or "estimate"
these amounts: if the year changes, re-read the page and replace the table.

Structure of the basket (identical in all three tracks):
  1. Ben Gurion payment, loaded onto a prepaid card on arrival (olim who change
     status inside Israel get it as a bank deposit instead).
  2. A one-time "bank top-up" (השלמה לחשבון בנק), paid into the Israeli bank
     account. It is a separate line, not part of the monthly instalments.
  3. Six monthly instalments. There is NO seventh payment: after month 6 the
     oleh is checked for income support (havtachat hachnasa), not another
     basket payment.

Tracks:
  standard    -- working-age oleh
  pre-pension -- reaches the statutory retirement age within 5 years of aliyah
  pensioner   -- already at the statutory retirement age set by law
Note the tracks key off the STATUTORY retirement age (67 for men; 62-65 for
women by birth year), not off age 65.

Usage:
    python scripts/sal-klita-calculator.py --status single
    python scripts/sal-klita-calculator.py --status couple --child-ages 3,9,17
    python scripts/sal-klita-calculator.py --status single --track pensioner
